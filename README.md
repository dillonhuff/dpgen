# Dynamic Programming Solution Generator

This repository contains solver that generates
dynamic programs that solve optimization problems
on subsequences.

The entire program is contained in `main.py`

Example problems included in `main.py`
* [Post office (IOI 2000)](https://ioinformatics.org/page/ioi-2000/26)


To run the examples:

```
python main.py
```

This make take a while due to a large test case
for the post office problem.
